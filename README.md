# Stope Stability Prediction System Using Time-Aware Deep Learning
A hybrid deep learning model for predicting underground mining stope stability using both static geotechnical features and time-series sensor data.

# Overview

This project is a prototype implementation of a machine learning system designed to predict the stability risk level of underground stopes in mining environments.

The system uses:

Static geological and engineering features (e.g., rock quality, depth, hydraulic radius)

Dynamic sensor data over time (e.g., deformation rate, seismic activity, stress changes)

It predicts the risk level of each stope as one of the following classes:

    0: Stable

    1: Elevated Risk

    2: High Risk

    3: Unstable

The aim is to help mining engineers identify unstable stopes early and prevent hazardous incidents.
